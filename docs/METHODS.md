# Methodology

This document describes the image processing pipeline and algorithms used in the FociPy project for the analysis of XRCC1 foci.

> **Note:** Algorithm parameters are subject to optimization during development.

## 1. Image Preprocessing

Before detection, raw images undergo preprocessing to reduce noise and normalize signal intensity.

- [TBD]

## 2. Nuclear Segmentation

The objective of this stage is to generate binary masks that separate cell nuclei from the background.

- [TBD]

## 3. XRCC1 Foci Detection

Signal analysis within the defined nuclear masks.

- [TBD]

## 4. Quantification Metrics

- [TBD]

## 5. Libraries and Environment

- [TBD]
